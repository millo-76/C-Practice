# C-Practice

This repository contains C++ practice projects and exercises for learning and improving C++ programming skills.

## Projects

### User-Login System
A complete user authentication system built in C++ that demonstrates object-oriented programming principles, file handling, and user input validation.

**Features:**
- User registration and login functionality
- Password validation and security
- Login attempt logging
- Menu-driven interface
- File-based data persistence

**Files Description:**
- `main.cpp` - Program entry point with main menu loop and AuthSystem integration
- `AuthSystem.h` / `AuthSystem.cpp` - Core authentication class handling user registration, login, and attempt logging
- `User.h` - User data structure definition
- `Utils.h` / `Utils.cpp` - Utility functions for input validation and helper methods

**What it demonstrates:**
- Class design and encapsulation
- File I/O operations
- Input validation and error handling
- Menu-driven program structure
- Security considerations in user authentication

## Getting Started
To compile and run any project:
```bash
cd User-Login/
g++ main.cpp -o user_login
./user_login
```

## Learning Objectives
This repository serves as a practical learning environment for:
- C++ syntax and best practices
- Object-oriented programming concepts
- File handling and data persistence
- Input validation and error management
- Program architecture and design patterns
